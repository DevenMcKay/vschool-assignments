      <h3>THE ROAD TO ENLIGHTENMENT</h3>
      <p>Littering a dark and dreary road lay the past relics of browser-specific tags, incompatible DOMs, broken CSS
        support, and abandoned browsers.</p>
      <p>We must clear the mind of the past. Web enlightenment has been achieved thanks to the tireless efforts of folk
        like the W3C, WASP, and the major browser creators.</p>
      <p>The CSS Zen Garden invites you to relax and meditate on the important lessons of the masters. Begin to see with
        clarity. Learn to use the time-honored techniques in new and invigorating fashion. Become one with the web.</p>
      <h3>SO WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?</h3>
      <p>There is a continuing need to show the power of CSS. The Zen Garden aims to excite, inspire, and encourage
        participation. To begin, view some of the existing designs in the list. Clicking on any one will load the style
        sheet into this very page. The HTML remains the same, the only thing that has changed is the external CSS file.
        Yes, really.</p>
      <p>CSS allows complete and total control over the style of a hypertext document. The only way this can be
        illustrated
        in a way that gets people excited is by demonstrating what it can truly be, once the reins are placed in the
        hands
        of those able to create beauty from structure. Designers and coders alike have contributed to the beauty of the
        web; we can always push it further.

      <h3>PARTICIPATION</h3>
      <p>
        Strong visual design has always been our focus. You are modifying this page, so strong CSS skills are
        necessary
        too, but the example files are commented well enough that even CSS novices can use them as starting points.
        Please see the <span> <a href="#" target="_blank"> CSS Resource Guide</a></span> for advanced tutorials and
        tips on working with CSS.
      </p>
      <p>You may modify the style sheet in any way you wish, but not the HTML. This may seem daunting at first if
        you’ve
        never worked this way before, but follow the listed links to learn more, and use the sample files as a
        guide.</p>
      <p>Download the sample <span><a href="#" target="_blank">HTML</a></span> and <span><a href="#" target="_blank">
            CSS</a></span> to work on a copy locally. Once you have completed
        your masterpiece (and please, don’t submit half-finished work) upload your CSS file to a web server under
        your
        control. <span><a href="#" target="_blank">Send us a link</a></span> to an archive of that file and all
        associated assets, and if we choose to
        use it we will download it and place it on our server.</p>
      <h3>BENEFITS</h3>
      <p>Why participate? For recognition, inspiration, and a resource we can all refer to showing people how amazing
        CSS
        really can be. This site serves as equal parts inspiration for those working on the web today, learning tool
        for
        those who will be tomorrow, and gallery of future techniques we can all look forward to.

      <h3>REQUIREMENTS</h3>
      <p>Where possible, we would like to see mostly CSS 1 & 2 usage. CSS 3 & 4 should be limited to widely-supported
        elements only, or strong fallbacks should be provided. The CSS Zen Garden is about functional, practical CSS and
        not the latest bleeding-edge tricks viewable by 2% of the browsing public. The only real requirement we have is
        that your CSS validates.</p>
      <p>Luckily, designing this way shows how well various browsers have implemented CSS by now. When sticking to the
        guidelines you should see fairly consistent results across most modern browsers. Due to the sheer number of user
        agents on the web these days — especially when you factor in mobile — pixel-perfect layouts may not be possible
        across every platform. That’s okay, but do test in as many as you can. Your design should work in at least IE9+
        and the latest Chrome, Firefox, iOS and Android browsers (run by over 90% of the population).</p>
      <p>We ask that you submit original artwork. Please respect copyright laws. Please keep objectionable material to a
        minimum, and try to incorporate unique and interesting visual themes to your work. We’re well past the point of
        needing another garden-related design.</p>
      <p>This is a learning exercise as well as a demonstration. You retain full copyright on your graphics (with
        limited
        exceptions, see <span><a href="#" target="_blank">submission guidelines</a></span>), but we ask you release your
        CSS under a Creative Commons
        license identical to the <span> <a href="#" target="_blank">one on this site</a></span> so that others may learn
        from your work.
